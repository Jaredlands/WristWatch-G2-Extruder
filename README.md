# WristWatch-G2-Extruder
This is WristWatch, a standalone extruder designed by @bythorsthunder WWG2 is built as an alternative to WristWatch BMG etruder - but it uses Galileo 2 insides for pushing filament. Development started approximately when G2SA was being worked on, but later Thor was kind enough to allow me help him with further refinements of this extruder.
