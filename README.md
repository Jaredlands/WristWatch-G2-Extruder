This is WristWatch, a standalone extruder designed by @bythorsthunder.

I'd like to express my immense gratitude to Jaredc01 & Jason from LDO for their outstanding work in designing and manufacturing a kit for this awesome extruder.

WWG2 is built as an alternative to [WristWatch BMG extruder](https://github.com/bythorsthunder/Voron_Mods/tree/main/Wristwatch_Extruder_BMG) - but it uses Galileo 2 insides for pushing filament. Development started approximately when G2SA was being worked on, but later Thor was kind enough to allow me help him with further refinements of this extruder. 

Extruder uses Orbiter 2 mounting pattern. I tested it with Xol toolhead, but other toolheads should work as well as long as they support mounting pattern. Mounts for other popular toolheads are being worked on as well, so, stay tuned.

Extruder is made up of 3 parts:  Main Body, Rear Plate and Tension Arm.

Additonal files:
1. Main body adapted for XOL2 adapter with front mounting [here](STLs/XOL2/Custom_Adapter_WWG2.stl).
2. Modified adapter for XOL2 toolhead [here](STLs/XOL2/Custom_Adapter_WWG2.stl).
3. Canboard mounts for umbilical

We would like to respect Jared's ongoing work, therefore CAD files will not be released yet. They will be released once Jared publishes files for main Galileo 2 projects.
